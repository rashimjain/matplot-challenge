The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft. This project involves a mock analysis of ride sharing data that includes information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The objective is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, we have to produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
